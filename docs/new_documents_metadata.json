    "abstract": "This paper formalizes the Cohen-Okebe (C-O) Sphere, a high-dimensional manifold for 14-level quantum systems (Qudits). We introduce the term 'Hyperposition' to describe the simultaneous occupancy of d = 14 basis states. Crucially, we demonstrate a method for calculating circular boundaries within this manifold using discrete vector summation, effectively bypassing the transcendental constant pi through the use of C-O Symmetry Constants.",

    "content_summary": "The paper argues that as quantum hardware evolves to Qudits (d=14), the Bloch Sphere is insufficient. It proposes the C-O Sphere optimized for d=14. It defines Hyperposition as a multiplexed 14-dimensional density matrix. It introduces a 'Pi-less' metric for circumference using discrete vector summation of adjacent states, where the total boundary is calculated as C_CO = d * L, removing the need for Pi."
